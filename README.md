# Multi-class-Classification-Neural-Network
This repository contains the implementation of a multi-class classification problem using a neural network. The project demonstrates the entire workflow of building, training, and evaluating a neural network to classify data into multiple categories.

## Overview
This project focuses on solving a multi-class classification task using deep learning techniques. Key aspects of the project include data preprocessing, model architecture design, and evaluation of model performance by taking a random image and its classifying accuracy.

### Key Features

#### Dataset: 
I used Fashion MNIST dataset ; Is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

#### Model Architecture:
A neural network with input, hidden, and output layers is employed. Activation functions and optimization techniques are selected to improve learning and accuracy.

#### Evaluation Metrics:
The model is evaluated using accuracy

## Results
The neural network demonstrated strong performance in classifying the dataset. Here are some highlights of the results:
* Accuracy : Achived an accuracy of %79 on the test dataset

  Model performed pretty well predicting labels on the Fashion MNIST dataset
